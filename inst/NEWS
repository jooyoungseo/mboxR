# mboxr 0.1.4

* Underlying Python code has been modified to address some critical issues that has caused errors when parsing "From," and "To" variables; this change will resolve any unexpected stops in `read_mbox()` and `merge_mbox_all()` functions.
* `read_mbox()` and `merge_mbox_all()` no longer saves an output as a CSV file since CSV format is not sufficient for handling a large amount of data and can even cause some issues; Rda file format is now supported instead.
* "cc" variable has newly been added to a returned tibble object for an mbox file.
* "date" variable is now automatically converted into `lubridate::as_datetime()` object with the default timezone as UTC.


# mboxr 0.1.3

* "UTF-8" has been applied to test mbox and Python files.
* Author field has been corrected in the Vignette.

# mboxr 0.1.2

* Example mbox files are added for testing purpose.
* New argument `path` is added for `merge_mbox_all()` function.
* A new column `to` is added for tibble output for a given mbox file.


# mboxr 0.1.1

* A new function `merge_mbox_all()` is added for merging all available mbox files in the current active directory into one mbox file as a tibble object.


# mboxr 0.1.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
